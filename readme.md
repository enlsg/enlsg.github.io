Enlightened Singapore
---

[Ingress](https://ingress.com/), is a location-based, augmented-reality mobile game developed by Niantic.
We created this page just to celebrate the new Ingress 2.0, aka, Ingress Prime.

What you see here is the source code for the static web for https://enl.sg,
brought to you by your fellow Singapore agents. It's built by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is
currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

We will update this site with more useful stuff in the near future. Stay tuned!
